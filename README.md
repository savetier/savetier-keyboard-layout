A new take on the Colemak layout, mostly for central European languages

From the alternative keyboard layouts my favourite is Colemak. However, it has its flaws for central and eastern European languages which I intent to fix with the Savetier layout.

The basic ideas:

1) As a German native speaker I am mostly writing German texts. Colemak was intended mostly for English texts. The German layout provides the Umlauts which are also used in other languages, like Hungarian, Turkish, or Swedish. That's why I have chosen the German keyboard layout as a basis. 

2) I wanted to include as many central and eastern European languages as possible. With this layout you should be able to write flawlessly in German, English, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, Slovene, Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Romanian, and Turkish without switching.

3) I wanted to keep the main keyboard-shortcuts at their place. A problem I see with Colemak is that e.g. CTRL+S (save) is at a different place (it kept cut/copy/paste, gladly). This could lead to a catastrophe if you have to often switch between QWERTY/Z and Colemak. For that reason I wanted to keep CTRL+A/S/X/C/V/Q/W as they were, and bring CTRL+F/P/Z/T within the closer reach of your left hand.

4) As a passionate gamer I wanted to keep at least W, A, S, D (for directions) at their place.

And this is the result so far:
