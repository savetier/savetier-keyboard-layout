A new take on the Colemak layout, mostly for central European languages

Of the alternative keyboard layouts my favourite is Colmak. However, it has its flaws which I intent to fix with the Savetier layout.

The basic ideas:

1) As a German native speaker I am mostly writing German texts. Colmak was intended mostly for English texts. That's why I have chosen the German keyboard layout as a basis. 

2) I wanted to include as many central and eastern European languages as possible. With this layout you should be able to write in German, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, Slovene, Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Romanian, and Turkish without switching.

3) I wanted to keep the main keyboard-shortcuts at their place. A problem I see with Colemak is that e.g. CTRL+S (save) is at a different place but it kept cut/copy/paste gladly. 

4) As a passionate gamer I wanted to keep at least W, A, S, D (for directions) at their place.

And this is the result so far:
